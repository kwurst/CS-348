## Prerequisites
* CS 343 Software Construction, Design and Architecture
* CM 110 Public Speaking
* UR 230 Technology, Public Policy and Urban Society

This course has a prerequisite of CS 343 – Software Construction, Design and Architecture. We will be looking at the process of planning and developing a large software project in a team, and so I expect you to have experience in developing software and working with others. You will be bringing your experiences in these situations, both good and bad, to our discussions of software process management, and your experiences will lead you to a better understanding of why such processes are needed.

CS 343 required EN 252 – Technical Writing. You should be able to write professionally. You should be able to write professional-quality reports, memos and documentation.

This course has a prerequisite of CM 110 – Public Speaking. You should be able to structure and give a professional-quality presentation.

This course has a prerequisite of UR 230 – Technology, Public Policy and Urban Society. I expect that you understand the concept of intellectual property, including copyright and licensing. We will be reading and comparing software licenses, and determining what effect a software license has on how we can use third-party code, why it is important to license our own code and documentation, and what to consider when choosing a license for our own work.

***If you are missing any of this background, you should not take this course.***

## Grading Policies
I want everyone receiving a passing grade in this course to be, at least, minimally competent in the course learning outcomes and for that to be reflected in your course grade. Traditional grading schemes do a poor job of indicating competency.

As an example, imagine a course with two major learning outcomes: X and Y. It is widely considered that a course grade of C indicates that a student is minimally competent in achieving the course outcomes. However, if the student were to receive a grade of 100 for outcome X, and a grade of 40 for outcome Y, the student would still have a 70 (C-) average for the course. Yet the student is clearly not competent in outcome Y.

Therefore the grading in this course will be handled in a different manner:

* All assignments will be graded on a ***Meets Specification*** / ***Does Not Yet Meet Specification*** basis, based on whether the student work meets the instructor-supplied specification. 
* A minimum collection of assignments, indicating competency in the course learning outcomes, must be completed in a ***Meets Specification*** manner to earn a passing course grade (D).
* Higher passing grades (A, B, C) can be earned by completing more assignments and/or assignments that show higher-level thinking and learning skills.

### Assignment Grading

* All assignments in this course will be graded exclusively on a ***Meets Specification*** / ***Does Not Yet Meet Specification*** basis. 
* **For each assignment, you will be given a detailed specification explaining what is required for the work to be marked *Meets Specification*.** 
* Failing to meet ***any part*** of the specification will result in the work being marked **Does Not Yet Meet Specification**. 
* There will be no partial credit given. 
* If you are unclear on what the specification requires, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
* It will be possible to revise and resubmit a limited number of assignments with **Does Not Yet Meet Specification** grades (see *Revision and Resubmission of Work* below).

### Course Grade Determination

Your grade for the course will be determined by which assignments and/or how many assignments you complete in an Meets Specification manner.

#### Base Grade

Assignment | Earn Base Grade<br>A | Earn Base Grade<br>B | Earn BaseGrade<br>C | Earn Base Grade<br>D 
--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
Attendance and Participation (out of 27) | 26 | 25 | 24 | 23
Assignments<br>&nbsp;(out of *n* assignments, where *n* &#8776; 8)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Base Assignment<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Intermediate "Add-On"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Advanced "Add-On" |  <br>*n*<br>4<br>2 | <br>*n*<br>2<br>1 | <br>*n*<br>1<br>&nbsp;  | <br>*n* - 1<br><br>&nbsp;
Exam Grade Average (3 exams) | > 50% | > 50% | > 50% | &le; 50%


* **Failing to meet the all the requirements for a particular letter grade will result in not earning that grade.** For example, even if you complete all other requirements for a B grade, but fail to submit and Advanced Add-On that meets specification, you will earn a C grade.
* **Failing to meet the all the requirements for earning a D grade will result in a failing grade for the course.**

#### Plus or Minus Grade Modifiers

* You will have a ***minus*** modifier applied to your base grade if the average of your exam grades is lower than 60%.
* You will have a ***plus*** modifier applied to your base grade if the average of your exam grades is 85% or higher.
* Each unused token remaining at the end of the semester can be used to increase the exam average by 2 percentage points.

*Note:*
 
* WSU has no A+ grade.

## Attendance and Participation
* For class sessions with a specific lab assignment, you are expected to work on the assigned laboratory material within your group. Every member of the group is expected to contribute. The group is expected to complete the lab assignment or make substantial progress toward the completion of the lab assignment. If you complete the assigned material before the end of class you must show the instructor before leaving.
* For class sessions with no specific lab assignment, you are expected to be paying attention, participating in the class discussion, and asking questions.
* Arriving late and leaving early (unless you have finished and shown your work to the instructor) will result in your work being considered "Does Not Yet Meet Specification" for that lab session.
* Working on things that are not part of the work for this class during class time will result in your work being considered "Does Not Yet Meet Specification" for that lab session.

## Assignments
The assignments will give you a chance to apply the material to larger tasks. The assignments will vary in what you will be asked to do - programming projects, written assignments, analysis, etc.

### Base Assignment
Every assignment will have a *base assignment* portion that must be completed for the assignment to be considered "Meets Specification". This will generally involve developing tests, determining suitable test inputs, and/or determining suitable test paths.

* Anyone working to earn a grade of C or higher must submit "Meets Specification" work for **all** Base Assignments.
* Anyone working to earn a grade of D or higher must submit "Meets Specification" work for **all but one** of the Base Assignments.

*A more complete specification for an "Meets Specification" (passing) Base Assignment will be given during with each assignment.*

### Intermediate "Add-On"
Each assignment will also have an *Intermediate Add-On* portion can be completed for anyone working for a course grade of C or higher. This will involve more detailed analysis of the developed model, design, architecture, or code.

* Differing numbers of Intermediate "Add-Ons" are required for different passing grades of C or higher. See the table under *Course Grade Determination*.

*A more complete specification for "Meets Specification" (passing) Intermediate "Add-Ons" will be given during with each assignment.*

### Advanced "Add-On"
Each assignment will also have an *Advanced Add-On* portion can be completed for anyone working for a course grade of B or higher. This will involve even more detailed analysis of the developed model, design, architecture, or code.

* Differing numbers of Advanced "Add-Ons" are required for different passing grades of B or higher. See the table under *Course Grade Determination*.

*A more complete specification for "Meets Specification" (passing) Advanced "Add-Ons" will be given during with each assignment.*

## Exams

There will be three exams, one of which will be a non-comprehensive final exam.

* Exam 1 is tentively scheduled to be given during class on the 14th or 15th of February 2018.
* Exam 2 is tentively scheduled to be given during class on the 14th or 15th of April 2018.
* Exam 3 will be given during the scheduled final exam period:
    * Section 01 &mdash; 10 May 2018 &mdash; 8:30-11:30am 
    * Section 02 &mdash; 14 May 2018 &mdash; 12:30-3:30pm 

## Deliverables
All work will be submitted electronically through a variety of tools. The due date and time will be given on the assignment. The submission date and time will be determined by the submission timestamp of the tool used.

**Please do not submit assignments to me via email.** It is difficult for me to keep track of them and I often fail to remember that they are in my mailbox when it comes time to grade the assignment.

## Late Submissions
Late work will not be accepted. (See *Tokens* below.)

## Revision and Resubmission of Work

Because your first attempt at producing acceptable work for a new category of assignment may be difficult due to being unfamiliar with the specification and not having had any feedback yet, you may revise and resubmit ***a single*** assignment in each of the following categories *only*:

* Base Assignment
* Intermediate Assignment "Add-On"
* Advanced Assignment "Add-On"

## Tokens
Each student will be able to earn up to 5 tokens over the course of the semeester. These tokens will be earned by completing simple set-up and housekeeping tasks for the course.

Each token can be used to:

* replace a single missed class session (up to a maximum of 3 missed class sessions)
* turn in an assignment late by 24 hours
* revise and resubmit an assignment (up to a maximum of 2) that was judged "Does Note Yet Meet Specification". Any work to be revised and resubmitted must have been submitted by the original due date. 

### Token Accounting
* Unused tokens will be kept track of in the Blackboard *My Grades* area.
* Tokens will not be automatically applied. You must explicitly tell me **by email** when you want to use a token, and for which assignment..

## Getting Help
If you are struggling with the material or a project please see me as soon as possible. Often a few minutes of individual attention is all that is needed to get you back on track.

By all means, try to work out the material on your own, but ask for help when you cannot do that in a reasonable amount of time. The longer you wait to ask for help, the harder it will be to catch up. 

**Asking for help or coming to see me during office hours is not bothering or annoying me. I am here to help you understand the material and be successful in the course.**

## Contacting Me
You may contact me by email (<a href="mailto:Karl.Wurst@worcester.edu">Karl.Wurst@worcester.edu</a>), telephone (+1-508-929-8728), or see me in my office. My office hours are listed on the schedule on my web page (<a href="http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/" target="_blank">http://cs.worcester.edu/kwurst/</a>) or you may make an appointment for a mutually convenient time.
